/**
 * Implements ID token logic
 *
 * ID tokens are used in token-based authentication to cache user profile information
 * and provide it to a client application, thereby providing better performance and
 * experience. The application receives an ID token after a user successfully authenticates,
 * then consumes the ID token and extracts user information from it, which it can
 * then use to personalize the user's experience.
 *
 * ID tokens follow the JSON Web Token (JWT) standard, which means that their basic structure
 * conforms to the typical JWT Structure, and they contain standard JWT Claims asserted
 * about the token itself.
 *
 * Beyond what is required for JWT, ID tokens also contain claims asserted about the
 * authenticated user, which are pre-defined by the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol,
 * and are thus known as standard OIDC claims. Some standard OIDC claims include:
 *
 * name
 * nickname
 * picture
 * email
 * email_verified
 *
