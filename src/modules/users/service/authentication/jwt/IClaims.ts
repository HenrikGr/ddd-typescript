/**
 * ID tokens are used in token-based authentication to cache user profile information
 * and provide it to a client application, thereby providing better performance and
 * experience. The application receives an ID token after a user successfully authenticates,
 * then consumes the ID token and extracts user information from it, which it can
 * then use to personalize the user's experience.
 *
 * For example, suppose you have a regular web app that you register and configure to allow
 * users to login with Google. Once a user logs in, use the ID token to gather information such as name
 * and email address, which you can then use to auto-generate and send a personalized welcome email.
 *
 * ID Tokens should never be used to obtain direct access to APIs or to make authorization decisions.
